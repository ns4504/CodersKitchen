# Coder's Kitchen
Coder's Kitchen is a recipe website created for people from all walks of life, from avid food enthusiests to people just trying to find tonight's dinner. It was created by Markeis Brown & Nathan Scott for their CIS Capstone project in May 2024.
The website begins on a landing page, that when clicked, will send users to the home page where they can view all of the options.
The home page includes a profile, recipe, recipe help, and share features. It also includes a simple chatbot in the bottom right.
When clicking any of the navigation buttons, users are brought to a login page where they can either log in or click another button to sign up.
Signups include forms that request for a username, email address, password, and profile image link. The email and password fields use Javascript to ensure both the email and password are proper.
Once logged in, users are brought to their profile where they can view everything they just entered and update their profiles or log out. If the user is an admin they can view the users database and edit users as they please, including making other admins.
As a side note: To create the initial admin account, the user must directly go into the database and change the "isAdmin" field from a 0 to a 1.
After the user views their profile, they can go anywhere on the website.
The most important part of the website is, of course, the recipes!
The recipe tab can be clicked and users can view everything the database holds about each recipe displayed in cards.
Users can view the unsorted list or view them by meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner, etc.) and cuisine (AKA country of origin).
The rest of the website is up to you to view and learn about...
